# Step 3: Download the sample document and upload to your collection

1. Download the following  **breaches.zip**  file and **extract**.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/breaches.zip" caption="Sample collection data" %}

2. Upload the document to your collection. Either drag and drop it into your collection, or click **browse from computer** to upload documents. After the upload is complete, the following information displays:

* The number of documents \(1\).
* The fields identified from your document. You should see one field identified, `text`. We will identify additional fields in a bit.
* Enrichments applied to your document. The Entity Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, Category Classification, and Concept Tagging enrichments are automatically applied to the `text` field by Discovery. Learn more about enrichments [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/discovery?topic=discovery-configservice#adding-enrichments)\).
* Pre-built queries you can run immediately.
