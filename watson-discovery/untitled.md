# About

This is the architecture of a complete Discovery solution:

![Discovery architecture diagram](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/902e665ae34b88b6b84d7abe3161aab07f6a410a/services/discovery/images/discovery-flow.png)

With Discovery, it only takes a few steps to prepare your unstructured data, create a query that will pinpoint the information you need, and then integrate those insights into your new application or existing solution.

How does Discovery do it? By using data analysis combined with cognitive intuition to take your unstructured data and enrich it so you can discover the information you need.

IBM Watson™ Discovery brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated Watson APIs to:

* Crawl, convert, enrich and normalize data.
* Securely explore your proprietary content as well as free and licensed public content.
* Apply additional enrichments such as concepts, relations, and sentiment through Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\).
* Simplify development while still providing direct access to APIs.
