2. On the **Build queries** screen, click on **Search for documents**, then **Use natural language**. Enter `What are the minimum hardware requirements` and click the **Run query** button. Click the **JSON** tab on the right. The result is not as precise as it could be, so let's improve it with Smart Document Understanding.

5. Click on the name of the collection \(**InstallDocs**\) on the upper left to return to the **Overview** screen.
